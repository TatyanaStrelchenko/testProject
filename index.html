            Innovation is in our DNA. We are proud to have designed solutions that were industry firsts.
            For example, our team developed one of the first Content Management Systems around the turn 
            of the millennium, we implemented technology used to launch and operate one of the first
            internationalized (multi-lingual) domain names in the world. Our team was involved with the 
            first commercial test of mobile OCR technology for mobile ticketing in North America.

            Because projects that we worked on over the years were often challenging and required a scientific
            approach, we always had high-level mathematicians and data scientists on the team. Thatâ€™s why, in 2017,
            we started a formal AI and ML department. This allows us to offer not only product development but also 
            comprehensive  <a href="https://integrio.net/artificial-intelligence" target="_blank" class="links"> artificial intelligence</a> and data science services to help our clients maintain a competitive edge.
